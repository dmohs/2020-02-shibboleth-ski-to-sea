Making the world a better place, through synergistic applicative face talking.

Engineering philosophy is important.

* Usability is everything.

== Practice philosophy

Put usability first. Become an expert in the tools. The law of trial and error necessitates a focus on productivity.

=== Developer usability



=== Product usability

== The Story of Shibboleth

== Version 1

=== Version 1, Environment

* FireCloud deploy practice: Jenkins -> GCE VM
* Secrets in Vault

=== Version 1, Developer Usability

* SAML is an unfamiliar technology.
* Support from eRA Commons IT department only via back-channel.
* Priority, then, is on preventing this pain for others.

=== Version 1, Product Usability

* Correct operation means users will not know the system exists.
* Priority is simplicity and stability.
* Simplicity helps ensure the developers implement the exchange correctly.

=== Version 1, Implementation

* libapache2-mod-shib2 (recommended by eRA Commons IT)
* Convert SAML exchange into JWT, signed with a shared secret.
* Full example flow implemented on production system.

=== A Note on Developer Usability

* Stack is ClojureScript on Node.
* Power versus learning curve.
  ** Software engineers are expert users.
  ** Therefore, I choose powerful tools and expect to invest more in training.

=== Version 1, Drawbacks

* Apache adds significant complexity.
** Tightly-coupled architecture adds deployment requirements
* Shared secret is hard to distribute.
  ** Requires coordination, which adds roughly an order of magnitude to clients' development efforts.

== Version 2

=== Version 2, Requirements

* Implement SAML exchange using a library.
  ** Greatly simplifies the system, reducing deployment requirements and increasing velocity.
* Use public/private key pair for JWT signing.
  ** Eliminates coordination requirement.

=== Version 2, Implementation

* saml2-js
* Node on GAE Standard
* Secrets in GCS

=== Vresion 2, Demo

* Dev and prod workflows.
* Example implementation.

== Appendix: App Engine REPL

=== Why?

* Dev environments are not common.
* Perfecting the dev environment requires expertise in the system.

=== How?

* Permissions
* Forking versus more subtle approaches
* Read-only directory
* Node require caching
* Separation of concerns
